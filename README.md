# Collaborative adaptive cruise control and energy management strategy for extended-range electric logistics van platoon

This paper improves the economy of the extended-range electric logistics van (ERELV) platoon from two aspects of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and energy management strategy (EMS).
Based on the DMPC algorithm, an Eco-CACC controller with the optimization goals of stability, comfort and energy-saving is designed.
The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm is used to solve the EMS of the ERELV platoon.
